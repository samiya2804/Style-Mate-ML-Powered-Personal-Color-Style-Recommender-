💖 StyleMate – ML-Powered Personal Color & Style Recommender

A personalized color profiling and fashion recommendation system using machine learning and image processing.

📌 Overview

StyleMate is a web-based application that analyzes a user's skin, hair, and eye color from an uploaded photo to determine their seasonal color type (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter). Based on this analysis, it provides personalized recommendations for clothing colors, makeup tones, and suitable fabrics using machine learning.

With an accuracy of 93.75%, the system combines color theory with ML to make fashion and cosmetic choices more inclusive and data-driven.

🚀 Features

📷 Upload a photo and extract color features (skin, hair, eye).

🎨 Predict seasonal color type using LAB color values.

🤖 ML model trained with Random Forest Classifier.

💄 Style suggestions for makeup or gromming tips, outfits, and clothes.

🧠 Based on color theory + personalized ML logic.

🌐 Responsive UI for seamless experience across devices.
